Orchestrate Installation of Software Packages

* Overview

Orchestrate automates the installation suites of packages from source.  

Details of the design and use of Orchestrate are in the [[./doc/orchestrate.org][doc/orchestrate.org]].

The orchestration is driven by a suite description file using a Python-based application and per-package Bash scripts.

Python versions before and including 2.4 is not supported.  Python 2.7 is recommended.  Other versions are not guaranteed to work.

* Installation

Orchestrate installs as a Python package in a few ways.  Which way is best to use depends on what the build host provides.  Each method is described below.

** Bootstrap installation

If the build host lacks a sufficiently new version of Python and/or =virtualenv= then it is recommended to use the [[./bash/bootstrap.sh]] script to install these.  To do that:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd orchestrate/
./bash/bootstrap.sh /path/to/venv [/path/to/temp]
#+END_EXAMPLE

If no temporary directory is given, one is generated in =/tmp=.
After the bootstrap completes successfully the temporary directory may be removed.

The resulting installation can be "activated" using the standard =virtualenv= mechanism:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
#+END_EXAMPLE

and later "deactivated" via:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
deactivate
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Preparing your own environment

If you want to provide your own Python environment it is still recommended to install Orchestrate into a =virtualenv=.  

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
virtualenv /path/to/venv
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, install Orchestrate as described in the next section.

** Existing environment

Given an existing, suitable Python environment the orchestrate package can be installed with, for example, =pip=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install /path/to/orchestrate-X.Y.tar.gz
#+END_EXAMPLE

** In-source use

Orchestrate can be run directly from the source if a suitable Python environment exists.  All that is needed is to locate its Python modules.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/orchestrate/python
#+END_EXAMPLE

** TODO: Installation from online package repository

T.b.d, provide online PyPi-style package repository and configuration instructions.

* Command Line Use

Orchestrate is run via the command =orch= except this doesn't yet exist.  For now the unit tests can drive the code.  For example:

* Configuration

The [[./doc/orchestrate.org][doc/orchestrate.org]] doc should be consulted.  The [[./tests/test.cfg]] file is a simple example used by the tests.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python tests/test_app.py
#+END_EXAMPLE
